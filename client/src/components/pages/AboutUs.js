                                    The U.S. alone contributions an esteemed 251 Million tons of consumer waste annually, but less than a third is recycled or composted. 
                                    As much as 40% of this waste comes from Construction Projects, which produce a surplus of unused building materials. 
                                    This is where the Green Cycle application comes into play - to track all the unused building material waste - either through demo or new Construction. 
                                    We want to tap into that market and make it a priority for these Contractors to recycle by making it a competition. 
                                    With the World moving more and more towards Green Energy and Recycling Tactics, we believe now is an opportune time to start tracking waste and making sure itâ€™s recycled.
