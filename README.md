# Green-Cycle

## Description
The U.S. alone contributions an esteemed 251 Million tons of consumer waste annually, but less than a third is recycled or composted. As much as 40% of this waste comes from Construction Projects, which produce a surplus of unused building materials. This is where the Green Cycle application comes into play - to track all the unused building material waste - either through demo or new Construction. We want to tap into that market & make it a priority for these Contractors to recycle by making it a competition. With the World moving more and more towards Green Energy and Recycling Tactics, we believe now is an opportune time to start tracking waste & making sure it’s recycled.
